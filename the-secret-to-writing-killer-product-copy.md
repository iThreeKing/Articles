# The Secret To Writing Killer Product Copy
# 产品文案要说人话

So much has changed for the better in the business world since Web 2.0 began, but there's one thing that seems like it's still stuck in the mid-90's: the way we write about the products we're building and selling.
自从 Web 2.0 以来，许多变革让商业世界变得更加美好，但有一件事，好像它仍停留在上世纪 90 年代中期：关于我们正在制作和销售产品文案的书写方式。

I have two thoughts on why this is the case, one more concerning than the other.
对于这样的情况我有两种想法，其中一种比另外一种更有关联。

#### Most people just aren't great writers.
#### 绝大多数人不是很优秀的文案作者

For many people, writing is a brutal exercise. It's not enjoyable, they don't know what to write, it takes forever or the result makes no sense.
对很多人来说，写作是一个残酷的运动。它很无趣，人们不知道写什么，耗费了大量时间，结果也没有意义。

And that's totally fine.
其实这很好。


What good would a team be if it was made up of people who all had the same skills, anyway? Personally, the way I just described how most people feel about writing is exactly how I can feel with big numbers or when I have to play around in Excel with large data sets.
一个优秀的团队一定是由具有相同技能的人组成吗？就我个人而言，我刚刚提到大部分人对于写作的感受的确是当我面对大量数字或者当我用 Excel 处理大量数据的感觉。（表示不知道他到底要表达什么）

#### **Marketers have become obsessed with having technical chops.**
#### **经销商已经成为痴迷技术的骨干**

This is the concerning one.
这种想法更有关联。

We get so caught up in a long list of technical skills because everyone wants to “build something” or be “data-driven” these days that one of the most important skills in business keeps getting sent to the back of the line: writing.
因为每个人都想“构建某事”或“数据驱动”，因为这些天我们陷入了一连串技术技能的问题中，其中在商业中不断保持发送回线的技能就是：写作。

But here's the thing.
但是这里有件事情。

**You don't need to be a professional writer** (read that 2x).
**你不需要成为一个专业的写手**(请读两遍)

I don't consider myself a writer at all.
我根本不认为自己是个写手。

Much of what I write would probably get _shredded_ by an English major or anyone with an AP Style Guide.
我写的很多东西也许会被英文专业或者以 AP 风格为指导的人_撕掉_。


The most underrated (and I'd argue important) skill that you need as a marketer today is simply the ability to write like a human.
做为一个营销者，你需要的最被低估(也就是我认为重要)的技能其实很简单，就是像一个正常人一样写作的能力。


> “Here's a simple trick for getting more people to read what you write: write in spoken language.” — [Paul Graham<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[1]</sup>](https://medium.com/u/1753cee1bce5)
> “这是一个简单的技巧，能够让更多的人阅读你写的东西：用口语话来写。” — [Paul Graham<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[1]</sup>](https://medium.com/u/1753cee1bce5)


> “The simple way to get better at business writing: don't do business writing.” — [Seth Godin<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[2]</sup>](https://medium.com/u/f9ac9806e153)
> “商务写作中变得更优秀的简易之路：不要采用商务写作。” — [Seth Godin<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[2]</sup>](https://medium.com/u/f9ac9806e153)

> “Let the real writers keep blowing our minds. Meanwhile, we'll try to get our message across as clearly as possible.” — [Ali Mese<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[3]</sup>](https://medium.com/u/d43c46db5b92)
> “让真正的读者紧跟我们的思想。同时，我们将尽可能的把我们的信息传递的清楚。” — [Ali Mese<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[3]</sup>](https://medium.com/u/d43c46db5b92)


### Customer-Driven Copywriting
### 客户驱动的文案策划

At [Drift<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[4]</sup>](http://blog.drift.com/), we call this customer-driven copywriting.
在这篇[文章<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[4]</sup>](http://blog.drift.com/)中, 我们称之其为客户驱动文案策划。

It doesn't matter if it's an email we're sending, copy on a landing page, or text in a tool-tip inside of our product, everything that we write has to be written in a way that our customers will understand and care about.
我们正在发送的邮件无论是从登陆页面复制而来还是我们产品内部的说明文字都无妨，所有我们写的东西必须按照我们客户理解和关心的方式来写。

**We always try and ask ourselves these questions:**
**我们总是尝试并问自己这些问题**

_Why should someone give a shit about this?_
_为什么会有人吐槽我的文案？_

_What's in it for the customer to read this?_
_对于客户来说读我的文案他会获得什么信息？_

_Is this how you'd explain this to a friend over a cup of coffee? Or if you had to walk up to a stranger in a bar?_
_或者如果你不得不在酒吧里走到陌生人身边？_

Here's the welcome email for signups from Drift.com. Simple, and sounds like something you' might actually say to a real human:
这是从 Drift.com 注册收到的一封欢迎信。很简单，它就好像你实际生活中会对一个真人说的那样：

[Segment<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[6]</sup>](https://segment.com/) is a tool that's built for engineers. If they can write amazing copy like this for a very technical product, so can you:
[Segment<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[6]</sup>](https://segment.com/) 是一个为工程师创造的工具。如果他们可以为每个很有技术含量的产品写出这样出色的文案，那么你也可以：

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PD8XfjXbB2SHTNFVUVA3Iw.png)

Same with [Stripe<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[7]</sup>](https://stripe.com/). Built for developers, but something that my Mom could understand. Sure, she won't know what “a set of unified APIs” means, but the great part about this message is that if you delete the first line, it's still 100% clear what Stripe does:
[Stripe<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[7]</sup>](https://stripe.com/) 也是一样，为开发者创造，但是只有一些东西我妈妈能懂。当然，她不会知道“一套统一 API ”是什么意思，但是这则信息很好的部分就是如果你删除了第一行， Stripe 仍然会 100% 的清楚。

[PillPack<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[8]</sup>](https://www.pillpack.com/) is an online pharmacy that ships prescription medicine right to your door. It would be pretty easy for them to get into the weeds of their business, but they keep things simple, clean and clear.
[PillPack<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[8]</sup>](https://www.pillpack.com/) 是一个可以派送处方药上门的在线药店。虽然这会使他们的业务陷入混杂的状况，但是他们保持事情简单、干净和清楚。

The key to rememeber as a marketer is that your job is not to stuff an entire idea down someone's throat the first time they visit your website. Your goal should always be to get someone interested enough to take the next step. PillPack does that by offering a better, simpler experience — something that most people don't expect to get from a pharmacy.
要记住作为营销者的关键是，你的工作并不是在某个人第一次访问你的网站时，把你的整个想法都灌输给他。你的目标应该总是当他足够感兴趣再进行下一步。PillPack 就是这样提供更好更简单的用户体验 － 绝大多数人不会从一家药店得到的东西。

### Finding Inspiration For Customer-Driven Copy
### 寻求客户驱动文案的灵感

I'm going to share a secret with you to help with your next blog post, email, landing page, whatever.
我将分享一个小秘密来帮助你完成下一篇博客、邮件、登陆页等等。

**Your customers are all over the Internet writing things in _their own words._**
**你的客户在互联网上写东西，用_他们自己的文字_**

Instead of trying to get inside of your customer's head or staring at a blank screen thinking to yourself “what would a customer say?” you can go out and _find_ those messages to use in your copy — and you don't even need to be a good writer.
你可以跳出思维定式并_找到_那些在你文案中使用的信息，即使你不是一个好的写手，而不是试图进入客户的大脑或者盯着一片空白的屏幕自己思考“客户会说些什么呢？”


Here are a few places to look.
这里还有一些需要注意的地方。

#### Notes From Customer Development
#### 记录客户的发展情况

Get tight with your product managers, designers, sales reps, and anyone who is talking to customers daily. If they're any good at their job, they will have pages and pages of notes of things customers said directly. Use those notes to write messages in the words of your customers. Why make things harder than they need to be? Say it how they say it.
加强与你的产品经理、设计者、销售代表还有任何每天与用户交流的人之间的联系。如果他们很擅长他们的工作，他们会有很多用户所直接谈及的笔记。使用这些笔记写出用客户自己的话来说的文案信息。为什么要强行增加难度呢？就用他们说话的方式来描述它就好。


#### Quora

I've been spending a lot of time (again) on Quora. It's an incredible resource because the intent is so high: someone came to a question and answer site to ask a question about something. It's one thing to think it, it's another thing to go over to Quora and ask a question.
我曾经花了很多时间逛 Quora 。它是一种难以置信的资源，因为它包含的意图如此之高：一个人来到问答页面来问提问关于某件事的问题。自己思考它是一回事，跑去 Quora 问个问题是另外一回事。

We have a tool that helps you measure NPS inside of your app, so I've been spending a lot of time trying to figure out how people talk about NPS in their own words.
我们有一个帮助计算自己应用内部 NPS (Net Promoter Score,即净推荐值，又称净促进者得分) 的工具，所以我曾花了很多时间试图查明人们如何用自己的话来谈论 NPS 。

Quora has been a goldmine, and many of the comments there helped [to write this post on NPS<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[9]</sup>](http://blog.drift.com/how-to-measure-nps).
Quora 像一个知识宝库并且这里有很多评论来帮助 [完成这篇关于 NPS 的文章<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[9]</sup>] (http://blog.drift.com/how-to-measure-nps)。

#### Product Hunt
#### 

There are rarely brand new ideas or products anymore. Use this to your advantage. [Product Hunt<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[11]</sup>](https://medium.com/u/b8b4445269d0) comments can be a great resource for copy.
现在少有全新的想法或者产品了。你可以把它变成你的优势。[Product Hunt<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[11]</sup>](https://medium.com/u/b8b4445269d0) 的评论可以为文案提供优秀的资源库。


The great part about Product Hunt is that the community is super active, so there are usually a lot of comments from users of that particular product.
Product Hunt 最棒的地方就是它的社区十分活跃，所以这里经常有许多来自特殊产品用户的评论。

We recently [launched a free tool<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[12]</sup>](http://www.drift.com/daily) that shows you who your VIP leads are (you get a daily email or Slack notifications) so I plugged a few ideas into the search box on Product Hunt and found a few startups that had built similar tools in the past but had been acquired and then shutdown.
我们最近发布了一款[免费工具<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[12]</sup>](http://www.drift.com/daily)，它会向你展示你的 VIP 用户是谁(你会收到每日邮件或者 Slack 通知)，于是我在 Product Hunt 的搜索框中搜索了一下，然后发现了几个之前也做过类似工具的创业公司，但是他们做完这个就倒闭了。

These comments were a huge help for writing a lot of the copy for the new free tool:
这些评论将会对写关于新的免费应用文案有巨大帮助：

#### Social Media
#### 社交媒体

It's easy to dismiss tweets. They're nice, we're vain, it's fun to see people sharing tweets about your product. But try and go one step further — what did they say? How did they say it?
不理会推特容易。他们有趣，我们自负，看到人们分享关于你产品的推特很有趣。但是尝试进一步考虑 － 他们说了什么？他们如何说这些？

There are two things most people do with tweets:
绝大多数人会用推特做这两件事：

*   Re-write them in their own words so the tweet sounds original
*   用自己的话重写推特，所以推特看起来比较正常
*   Re-write them in their own words so the tweet can fit in 140 characters
*   用自己的话重写推特，让它刚好符合 140 词的要求

Bingo. You can use tweets about your products as inspiration for copy. These are people saying things in their own words.
当然，你可以把关于你自己产品的推特作为文案的灵感。它们就是用他们自己的话来描述事物。

For example: new leads with context. That's not a message we led with for Drift, but it's a great message!
举个例子：

#### Amazon Reviews

Have you ever noticed how many people write reviews for products on Amazon? Every product — from books to shoes to shampoo.

Plug in something that is related to your business on Amazon, find a product, and mine the reviews for copy ideas — straight from the mouth of a potential customer.

Even if you aren't building a consumer product, there are plenty of other ways to find reviews.

Are you building a new marketing software platform? There won't be reviews for marketing software platforms on Amazon, but there _will_ be reviews for books about marketing.

_Hat tip to_ [_Joanna Wiebe_<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[13]</sup>](https://medium.com/u/58a844d8d962) _who writes Copy Hackers for this one. You should read_ [_her full post on how to do this_<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[14]</sup>](https://copyhackers.com/2014/10/amazon-review-mining/) _if you're interested._

It doesn't matter where you go looking for ideas, but the point is that there are copy ideas everywhere. Sometimes we just need to get out of our own heads a little bit in order to find them.

Customer-driven copywriting.

# The Secret To Writing Killer Product Copy
# 产品文案要说人话

So much has changed for the better in the business world since Web 2.0 began, but there's one thing that seems like it's still stuck in the mid-90's: the way we write about the products we're building and selling.
自从 Web 2.0 以来，许多变革让商业世界变得更加美好，但有一件事，好像它仍停留在上世纪 90 年代中期：关于我们正在制作和销售产品文案的书写方式。

I have two thoughts on why this is the case, one more concerning than the other.
对于这样的情况我有两种想法，其中一种比另外一种更有关联。

#### Most people just aren't great writers.
#### 绝大多数人不是很优秀的文案作者

For many people, writing is a brutal exercise. It's not enjoyable, they don't know what to write, it takes forever or the result makes no sense.
对很多人来说，写作是一个残酷的运动。它很无趣，人们不知道写什么，耗费了大量时间，结果也没有意义。

And that's totally fine.
其实这很好。


What good would a team be if it was made up of people who all had the same skills, anyway? Personally, the way I just described how most people feel about writing is exactly how I can feel with big numbers or when I have to play around in Excel with large data sets.
一个优秀的团队一定是由具有相同技能的人组成吗？就我个人而言，我刚刚提到大部分人对于写作的感受的确是当我面对大量数字或者当我用 Excel 处理大量数据的感觉。（表示不知道他到底要表达什么）

#### **Marketers have become obsessed with having technical chops.**
#### **经销商已经成为痴迷技术的骨干**

This is the concerning one.
这种想法更有关联。

We get so caught up in a long list of technical skills because everyone wants to “build something” or be “data-driven” these days that one of the most important skills in business keeps getting sent to the back of the line: writing.
因为每个人都想“构建某事”或“数据驱动”，因为这些天我们陷入了一连串技术技能的问题中，其中在商业中不断保持发送回线的技能就是：写作。

But here's the thing.
但是这里有件事情。

**You don't need to be a professional writer** (read that 2x).
**你不需要成为一个专业的写手**(请读两遍)

I don't consider myself a writer at all.
我根本不认为自己是个写手。

Much of what I write would probably get _shredded_ by an English major or anyone with an AP Style Guide.
我写的很多东西也许会被英文专业或者以 AP 风格为指导的人_撕掉_。


The most underrated (and I'd argue important) skill that you need as a marketer today is simply the ability to write like a human.
做为一个营销者，你需要的最被低估(也就是我认为重要)的技能其实很简单，就是像一个正常人一样写作的能力。

### Customer-Driven Copywriting
### 客户驱动的文案策划

At [Drift<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[4]</sup>](http://blog.drift.com/), we call this customer-driven copywriting.
在这篇[文章<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[4]</sup>](http://blog.drift.com/)中, 我们称之其为客户驱动文案策划。

It doesn't matter if it's an email we're sending, copy on a landing page, or text in a tool-tip inside of our product, everything that we write has to be written in a way that our customers will understand and care about.
我们正在发送的邮件无论是从登陆页面复制而来还是我们产品内部的说明文字都无妨，所有我们写的东西必须按照我们客户理解和关心的方式来写。

**We always try and ask ourselves these questions:**
**我们总是尝试并问自己这些问题**

_Why should someone give a shit about this?_
_为什么会有人吐槽我的文案？_

_What's in it for the customer to read this?_
_对于客户来说读我的文案他会获得什么信息？_

_Is this how you'd explain this to a friend over a cup of coffee? Or if you had to walk up to a stranger in a bar?_
_或者如果你不得不在酒吧里走到陌生人身边？_

Here's the welcome email for signups from Drift.com. Simple, and sounds like something you' might actually say to a real human:
这是从 Drift.com 注册收到的一封欢迎信。很简单，它就好像你实际生活中会对一个真人说的那样：

[Segment<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[6]</sup>](https://segment.com/) is a tool that's built for engineers. If they can write amazing copy like this for a very technical product, so can you:
[Segment<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[6]</sup>](https://segment.com/) 是一个为工程师创造的工具。如果他们可以为每个很有技术含量的产品写出这样出色的文案，那么你也可以：

Same with [Stripe<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[7]</sup>](https://stripe.com/). Built for developers, but something that my Mom could understand. Sure, she won't know what “a set of unified APIs” means, but the great part about this message is that if you delete the first line, it's still 100% clear what Stripe does:
[Stripe<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[7]</sup>](https://stripe.com/) 也是一样，为开发者创造，但是只有一些东西我妈妈能懂。当然，她不会知道“一套统一 API ”是什么意思，但是这则信息很好的部分就是如果你删除了第一行， Stripe 仍然会 100% 的清楚。

[PillPack<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[8]</sup>](https://www.pillpack.com/) is an online pharmacy that ships prescription medicine right to your door. It would be pretty easy for them to get into the weeds of their business, but they keep things simple, clean and clear.
[PillPack<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[8]</sup>](https://www.pillpack.com/)

The key to rememeber as a marketer is that your job is not to stuff an entire idea down someone's throat the first time they visit your website. Your goal should always be to get someone interested enough to take the next step. PillPack does that by offering a better, simpler experience — something that most people don't expect to get from a pharmacy.

### Finding Inspiration For Customer-Driven Copy

I'm going to share a secret with you to help with your next blog post, email, landing page, whatever.

**Your customers are all over the Internet writing things in _their own words._**

Instead of trying to get inside of your customer's head or staring at a blank screen thinking to yourself “what would a customer say?” you can go out and _find_ those messages to use in your copy — and you don't even need to be a good writer.

Here are a few places to look.

#### Notes From Customer Development

Get tight with your product managers, designers, sales reps, and anyone who is talking to customers daily. If they're any good at their job, they will have pages and pages of notes of things customers said directly. Use those notes to write messages in the words of your customers. Why make things harder than they need to be? Say it how they say it.

#### Quora

I've been spending a lot of time (again) on Quora. It's an incredible resource because the intent is so high: someone came to a question and answer site to ask a question about something. It's one thing to think it, it's another thing to go over to Quora and ask a question.

We have a tool that helps you measure NPS inside of your app, so I've been spending a lot of time trying to figure out how people talk about NPS in their own words.

Quora has been a goldmine, and many of the comments there helped [to write this post on NPS<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[9]</sup>](http://blog.drift.com/how-to-measure-nps).

#### Product Hunt

There are rarely brand new ideas or products anymore. Use this to your advantage. [Product Hunt<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[11]</sup>](https://medium.com/u/b8b4445269d0) comments can be a great resource for copy.

The great part about Product Hunt is that the community is super active, so there are usually a lot of comments from users of that particular product.

We recently [launched a free tool<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[12]</sup>](http://www.drift.com/daily) that shows you who your VIP leads are (you get a daily email or Slack notifications) so I plugged a few ideas into the search box on Product Hunt and found a few startups that had built similar tools in the past but had been acquired and then shutdown.

These comments were a huge help for writing a lot of the copy for the new free tool:

#### Social Media

It's easy to dismiss tweets. They're nice, we're vain, it's fun to see people sharing tweets about your product. But try and go one step further — what did they say? How did they say it?

There are two things most people do with tweets:

*   Re-write them in their own words so the tweet sounds original
*   Re-write them in their own words so the tweet can fit in 140 characters

Bingo. You can use tweets about your products as inspiration for copy. These are people saying things in their own words.

For example: new leads with context. That's not a message we led with for Drift, but it's a great message!

#### Amazon Reviews

Have you ever noticed how many people write reviews for products on Amazon? Every product — from books to shoes to shampoo.

Plug in something that is related to your business on Amazon, find a product, and mine the reviews for copy ideas — straight from the mouth of a potential customer.

Even if you aren't building a consumer product, there are plenty of other ways to find reviews.

Are you building a new marketing software platform? There won't be reviews for marketing software platforms on Amazon, but there _will_ be reviews for books about marketing.

_Hat tip to_ [_Joanna Wiebe_<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[13]</sup>](https://medium.com/u/58a844d8d962) _who writes Copy Hackers for this one. You should read_ [_her full post on how to do this_<sup class="readableLinkFootnote">[14]</sup>](https://copyhackers.com/2014/10/amazon-review-mining/) _if you're interested._

It doesn't matter where you go looking for ideas, but the point is that there are copy ideas everywhere. Sometimes we just need to get out of our own heads a little bit in order to find them.

Customer-driven copywriting.
